===========================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
===========================================

If products don't load:
- Verify SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN is correct (no https://, no trailing slash)
- Verify SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_ACCESS_TOKEN is valid and has read_products scope
- Verify SHOPIFY_COLLECTION_HANDLE matches your collection's handle exactly

If orders fail to create:
- Verify SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_ACCESS_TOKEN has write_draft_orders scope
- Check Shopify Admin > Apps > Your App > API scopes

If emails don't send:
- Verify SMTP credentials are correct
- For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- Check SMTP_PORT and SMTP_SECURE match your provider's requirements
- Verify FROM_EMAIL is a valid sender address

If Excel file links don't work:
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL matches your Vercel deployment URL
- Check that the /api/excel/[filename] route is accessible
- Ensure excel-files directory is writable (Vercel handles this automatically)

===========================================

- All environment variables are case-sensitive
- Do not include quotes around values in Vercel
- NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are exposed to the browser (safe for public URLs)
